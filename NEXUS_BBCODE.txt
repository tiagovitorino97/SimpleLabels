[size=4][b]What Is It?[/b][/size]
Simple Labels lets you add [b]custom text labels[/b] to storage units and crafting stations so you can see at a glance what's where. Labels also show on your [b]clipboard[/b], so your production line stays clear and organized without breaking immersion. Works with [b]all station types[/b] and storage closet variants, with a [b]clean, in-game look[/b] that fits the game.

[size=4][b]Key Features[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][b]Custom labels[/b] on storage and stations (including mushroom spawn and all closet variants)
[*]Labels on the [b]clipboard[/b] for a clear overview of your setup
[*][b]Per-save labels[/b] – each save has its own labels; no mixing between games
[*][b]Color options[/b] with auto-color based on contents
[*][b]Multiplayer support[/b] – labels can sync between players (optional: requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/1396]SteamNetworkLib[/url] in UserLibs)
